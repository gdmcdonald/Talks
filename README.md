## Generative AI

### 2024-09-10 [Gen-AI applications for Early-Mid Career Researchers](2024-09-10%20Gen-AI%20applications%20EMCR%20Gordon%20McDonald.pdf)

Research Insights Series talk on GenAI by me, paired with a separate talk by Dr. Adele Haythornthwaite.

> There has been a very rapid and wide uptake of innovative new Generative AI (GenAI) technologies over the past two years. While it undoubtedly has had many positive impacts for research, there are significant risks and disadvantages in its use. How do researchers engage with this exciting new technology to optimise their work, while recognising and managing risks to ensure its safe use? 
>
> This session’s speakers will explore how to achieve a balance between opportunity and risk in using GenAI for research, including examples of innovative research use cases followed by a brief rundown of identifying and managing risks in order to maintain research integrity and data security.
> 
> SPEAKERS:
> Dr Gordon McDonald - Informatics Team Lead, Sydney Informatics Hub.
> Dr Adele Haythornthwaite - Manager, Research Data Strategy. 

### 2024-02-21 [AI in Research](./2024-02-21%20RP%20Researcher%20Spotlight%20AI%20in%20Research%20Henry%20Lydecker%20Gordon%20McDonald.pdf) 

Research portfolio researcher spotlight talk given by [Dr. Henry Lydecker](https://github.com/hlydecker) and myself. 

> Discover how AI is transforming our everyday work as researchers, and unlocking new capabilities in areas such as biotechnology, geospatial analysis, medical imagery and microscopy, conservation, and linguistics. We’ll share how the Sydney Informatics Hub is working with researchers across the university to shape the future of scientific discovery and innovation within our own research portfolio.

### 2023_11_30 [Gen-AI in Research Masterclass](2023_11_30-gen_ai_research_masterclass.pdf) [(Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnU8bQfR39w)

Presented by [Dr. Henry Lydecker](https://github.com/hlydecker) and Dr. Gordon McDonald of the [Sydney Informatics Hub](https://sydney.edu.au/informatics-hub), on the 30th November 2023, as part of CSIRO's National AI Month.

> Everyone is using ChatGPT these days, but how exactly can you get the most out of generative AI tools for your research?
In this [Sydney Informatics Hub](https://sydney.edu.au/informatics-hub) Masterclass we'll show you three killer ways you can take advantage of these new AI magic tricks so you can use them like a research wizard. We'll briefly overview the traps to avoid, and then show you a glimpse of the future where AI does the boring parts of your job for you! 

### 2023_09_26 [ChatGPT for Research](2023_09_26-Chat_GPT_for_Research_Gordon_McDonald.pdf)

Talk at [ResBaz Sydney 2023](https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2023syd/).

### 2023-07-14 [Generative AI: its use in research @ Centenary Institute Seminar Series](2023_07_14-generative_ai_centenary.pdf)

> Drs McDonald and Lydecker will provide an overview of the Sydney Informatics Hub at USYD, and how or what they can help with various research projects. You will learn about what Large Language Models (LLMs) are and what they aren’t. The latest buzz around generative Artificial Intelligence (eg ChatGPT) will be reviewed for the opportunities it brings. The presentation will cover existing big tools and models (GPT, PALM, Ilama, Falcon) and ways to use these Chat and Application Programming Interfaces for cool techniques for summarising, rewording, NLP tasks and reviewing. New technologies bring risks such as privacy concerns, IP, data sovereignty and reliability. These risks will be addressed on how to mitigate them using LangChain and alternative LLMs run internally. This field is moving rapidly and this special seminar has been organised to keep us up-to-date with the evolving technologies, their opportunities and risks, and how we can use it to the best of our advantage research settings.

### 2023-02-23 [ChatGPT Masterclass](2023-02-23%20chatgpt_masterclass.pdf) [(Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1OIpru7dhY)

> In this 1 hr masterclass, [Dr. Henry Lydecker](https://github.com/hlydecker) and Dr. Gordon McDonald from the University of Sydney's [Sydney Informatics Hub](https://sydney.edu.au/informatics-hub) discuss:
> - What ChatGPT is, 
> - A brief history of how we got here, 
> - Some ideas on how you can use it to accelerate your research
> - Some pitfalls to beware of
> - Some ethical/legal/moral and IP considerations for use of the tool.
